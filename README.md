# TallyHo (Open Source Archive - 2020-2024)

This open-source version of TallyHo is no longer actively maintained. The project has evolved into a hosted Progressive Web App that's easier to use and always up-to-date.

## What happened to the open source version?

After four years of development (2020-2024), I rebuilt TallyHo as a hosted Progressive Web App. Here's why:

**No technical setup required** - Start tracking time immediately without installing software or configuring databases

**Always current** - Automatic updates mean you never need to manually upgrade or migrate data

**Works everywhere** - Access from any device with a browser (desktop, mobile, tablet)

**Better security** - Hosted infrastructure with encrypted backups and proper authentication

**Improved features** - Faster development cycle means better tools for freelancers

## Try the current version

TallyHo is now a free, hosted PWA:
- Free Forever Plan (5 clients, unlimited projects)
- Pro Plan ($5/month) for unlimited clients
- Install as a native-like app on any device
- Secure, encrypted, GDPR-compliant

## About this repository

This repo contains the original open-source version (2020-2024) that required self-hosting. While functional, it lacks many features from the current PWA:

- Zapier integration for automated workflows
- Smart time-gap detection
- Progressive Web App capabilities
- Mobile-optimised interface
- Advanced insights and analytics
- Professional timesheet generation

## Historical context

The open-source version served as the MVP that validated TallyHo's approach to time tracking for freelancers. It proved that:

- Freelancers want simple, focused tools (not complex team platforms)
- A decent chunk of use freelncers prefer post-completion logging over timer-based or app-usage tracking
- Universal compatibility (copy-paste timesheets) beats fragile integrations

These insights shaped the current PWA, which delivers the same philosophy with a dramatically better user experience.

## For developers

If you're interested in building your own time tracking tool, this codebase might provide useful insights, but I'd recommend starting fresh with modern tooling. The current TallyHo uses:

- SvelteKit 5
- TailwindCSS 4
- Progressive Web App architecture
- Cloudflare hosting
